    "\n",
    "Toronto is one of the biggest cosmopolitan cities in the world and a has a lot of new immigrants every year.Through this capstone project, immigrants will have an easier time to determine potential neighborhoods of interest. For example, factors such as easy access to Cafes, Schools, hospitals, etc will be taken into account. This being said, immigirants and people who have recently moved into Toronto can be said to be the main target consumer for this project.\n",

To be able to do that, we need to cluster data which is a form of unsupervised machine learning: k-means clustering algorithm."

    "In this project, I used k-means cluster algorithm to seperate the neighborhoods into 10(Ten) different clusters with 103 different lattitudes and logitudes extracted from the dataset.
